VineLine
=========

This is a prototype for a fun drawing tool - as you drag your finger across the canvas the line grows branches which sprout leaves. The branches are randomly generated within certain parameters and animate on while you draw the main line.

Yes, the leaves are very realistic looking, thank you.

You can read more about how it works in [the blog post](https://iosapp.dev/2014/01/30/uibezierpath-cashapelayer-fun.html), note that the master branch contains a Swift translation of the code discussed in that blog post, you can see the original version on the [objective-c branch](https://github.com/mbehan/vine-line/tree/objective-c).
